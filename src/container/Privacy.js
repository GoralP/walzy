              </p>
              <p>
                Our Platform may contain electronic images known as Web beacons

                Platform is used. We use third parties to gather information
                about how you and others use the Platform. For example, we will
                know how many Users access a specific page and which User

                other users. We maintain these technical and organizational
                measures and will amend them from time to time to improve the

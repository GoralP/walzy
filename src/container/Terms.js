                a single combined service or app, or when there are regulatory
                changes. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to

                Terms, such as through a notice on our Platform, however, you

                    If you have assigned your rights to a music publisher, then
                    you must obtain the consent of such music publisher to grant
                    the royalty-free license(s) set forth in these Terms in your
                    User Content or have such music publisher enter into these
                    Terms with us. Just because you authored a musical work
                    (e.g., wrote a song) does not mean you have the right to
                    grant us the licenses in these Terms. If you are a recording
                    artist under contract with a record label, then you are
                    solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the
                    Services is in compliance with any contractual obligations
                    you may have to your record label.
